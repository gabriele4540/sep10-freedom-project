##### Software/hardware that are helpful in vetinary medicines.
<p>  There are alot of medical items in vetinary medicines that have helped save animals and spot things the naked eye cant see. For example, the xray that can see through everything and spot abnormalities in bones like broken, dislocated, or crooked healed bones. Another hardware device made to help vets get the job done was 3d printers to make new hardware to help pets heal. for example, prosthetics, these were used to help pet animals to move if they were disabled or if they lost it in an unfortunate accident. </p>
