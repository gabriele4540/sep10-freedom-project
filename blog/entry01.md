# Entry 1 Deciding on my topic (The Medical Field)
10/7/25

Choosing a topic

Content

I have decided that the topic I will work on is the medical field. The reason For this, is because I want to be in vetinary school when I grow up and help animals recover. Ive always been working hard in my default classes like math chemistry and history so that one day I can finally work on my passion of being a vetinary doctor. Ive always loved animals for as long as I can remember ive searched up what skills you need to master to become a doctor like the one I want to be and worked really hard to master them myself. The pro's of being a vet are very benevolent and lively as I can have the honor and pleasure of making saving a animals life and make peoples years in their life. The cons are the cost of the bills that it takes for these surgeries. You can also say the same for doctors too but vets also have these problems. I want to make a vet that is a non profit and helps animals and owners that dont have the insurance or bills to pay for their sweet pets lives.

  economics

 I had always had a knack for money and economics because I want to be smart with my money. And, become succesful so I can help others be well off their way to success with the skills that I have. found after my day of research.
    skills

There is alot of skills that I had learned during researching economics and one of those skills are investments like crypto and smp 500 that is a tax free money collector that will make you a millionaire in 25 years. In addition, you shouldnt put all your eggs in one basket that way there are multiple oppurtunities for you to become succesful. For example, If I were to put down all the money into stocks and not safe options like smp 500 then theres a high chance I will lose some money if those stocks start to fail. On the other hand, I know I would be good at this job but there is some downsides to it for society. Ill get more knowledge about money then other people and thats just not fair because their some people that just want to get their life started but dont have any economic smarts. But the same can be said about pro's as well as I can teach them myself and also build schooles about economics.
