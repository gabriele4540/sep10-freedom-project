# Entry 1 Deciding on my topic (The Medical Field)
10/7/25

Choosing a topic



I have decided that the topic I will work on is the medical field. The reason why, is because I want to be in vetinary school when I grow up and help animals recover. Ive always been working hard in my default classes like math chemistry and history so that one day I can finally work on my passion of being a vetinary doctor. Ive always loved animals for as long as I can remember ive searched up what skills you need to master to become a doctor like the one I want to be and worked really hard to master them myself. some websites ive found that have been helpful in getting to know animal health better is animal health facts or the Animal health medical assosiation. That has given me alot of info on how to take care of my dog and others to if there is a emergency. 

  economics

 I had always had a knack for money and economics because I want to be smart with my money and become succesful so I can help others be succesful to with the skills that I have found after my day of research
    skills

There is alot of skills that I had learned during researching economics and one of those skills are investments like crypto and smp 500 that is a tax free money collector that will make you a millionaire in 25 years. In addition, you shouldnt put all your eggs in one basket that way there are multiple oppurtunities for you to become succesful. For example, If I were to put down all the money into stocks and not safe options like smp 500 then theres a high chance I will lose some money if those stocks start to fail.
