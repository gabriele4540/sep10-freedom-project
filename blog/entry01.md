# Entry 1 Deciding on my topic (The Medical Field)
10/7/25

Choosing a topic



    I have decided that the topic I will work on is the medical field. The reason why, is because I want to be in vetinary school when I grow up and help animals recover. Ive always been working hard in my default classes like math chemistry and history so that one day I can finally work on my passion of being a vetinary doctor. Ive always loved animals for as long as I can remember ive searched up what skills you need to master to become a doctor like the one I want to be and worked really hard to master them myself. some websites ive found that have been helpful in getting to know animal health better is animal health facts or the Animal health medical assosiation. That has given me alot of info on how to take care of my dog and others to if there is a emergency. 

  economics/Real estate agent

    The Reason I want to be a real estate agent is because I want to be a middle man for the seller and the person so that I can get some of the money that I helped the seller sell In addition to helping the person find the right shelter that they need so that they can survive comfortably in society.
